### GitHub repo: [code-examples-python](./README.md)

This GitHub repo includes code examples for the [Web Forms API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/web-forms-api/), [Maestro API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/maestro-api/), [Docusign Admin API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/admin-api/), [Click API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/), [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/), [Monitor API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/monitor-api/), and [Rooms API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/). 



## Introduction

This repo is a Python 3 application that supports the following authentication workflows:

* Authentication with Docusign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.

* Authentication with Docusign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## eSignature API

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the Docusign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [Docusign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A Docusign app and integration key that is configured to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/) authentication.

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.  
   
   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.  

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the User ID GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.  

   For both authentication flows:  
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of http://localhost:3000/ds/callback

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as   
   
   {base_url}/ds/callback
   
   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.

1. Python 3.
1. If you are working on a Windows with a Python version after 3.10 you will also need to install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022). After installing that run `pip install --upgrade setuptools`.

### Installation steps

**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the Docusign Developer Center, skip step 4 as it was automatically performed for you.

1. Extract the Quickstart ZIP file or download or clone the code-examples-python repository.
1. In your command-line environment, switch to the folder:  
   `cd <Quickstart folder>` or `cd code-examples-python`
1. To install dependencies, run: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  (or pipenv can be used)
1. To configure the launcher for [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) authentication, create a copy of the file app/ds_config_sample.py and save the copy as app/ds_config.py.
